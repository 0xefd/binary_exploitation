# BRIEF WRITEUP OF IT:

## 1. THE STACK AND THE HEAP AND ADJACENT LIKE THIS 

		HEAP -> PIN
		SOMEDATA -> this data is essentially NOASLR data	
 		STACK -> input

## 2. So the attack plan is

	 	HEAP-> \x00
		somedata -> this data is overwritten properly
		stack -> input is \x00

## 3. now the null compares to null and you have the check bypassed

# NOTE: wasm binaries hav noaslr so it can be dumped with debugger using wasmtime
