## AVERAGES

- this is basically a stack uninitialisation issue 
- where you can add hex that is characters with 0 so it remains unchanged and the multiply the result by 20 to get back the original "flag" value
- to move up by 4 bytes you can use the + or - or any invalid which with scanf doesn't do anything but moves up the pointer from that so we can iterate for each player until the whole flag is retrieved

## primes

- this was a race-condition challenge where only the specific hash could be executed and if there was another hash then it wouldn't 
- so basically start with the file laksh.c it appends.exe to the file it trusts and the program gives us time to overwrite the laksh.c with the exploit.sh of the laksh.c.exe which finally executes this means that the sh script is executed
- this is then caught via the webhhook, which is the flag
